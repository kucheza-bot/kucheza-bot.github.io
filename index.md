No setup is required by default. The bot will immediately be working on invite. Setting up just allows you to customize the bot's triggers (.ct , .cbt , .triggers (on/off) )
To start, type **.ct** | **.cbt** | **.triggers**

・cbt is custom better triggers which the bot will react to specific words in a sentence.
